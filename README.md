# Portfolio

This is my portfolio repository. It is basically a timeline of the stuff I've created during the years across several platforms

## Commodore 64

### Neagox
This is a small (unfinished) game for the Commodore 64. We were three guys (me, Peter and Jacob) and we submitted the game to Hewson. Got good grades for the graphics, the music and the overall technical implementation. We got shitty grades for the gameplay and the overall design of the levels. You know, the stuff that matters.

It's a shitty game.

## Amiga

I was a part of the 'scene - yuuup, the good 'ol scene. Those were the days ... greetz to [Bastards](http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=1938), [Asperity](http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=29050), [Disorder](http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=25712), [Cyber Visions](http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=59937), [Kefrens](http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=665) and others!

## Palm OS

The period where I developed for the Palm OS is probably my most active period. I was almost in love with the platform :-)

The programs are written in _c_ and some of the programs have a desktop companion conduit written in _c++_ (-ish).

## Pebble

The Pebble Smartwatch was a totally awesome smartwatch and I created a couple of apps for it.
The apps are written in _c_.

All apps and watchfaces are precompiled, [ready to install](pebble/precompiled-pbws/).

## Mobile platforms

During the years I've been attacted to mobile (phone / platform) development.

### J2ME

Java 2 MicroEdition (J2ME) programs for the old Nokia Series 30, 40 and 60 and Ericsson phones.
J2ME programs are written in Java. The _Build Tools_ folder contains some of the build tools I developed for my own usage.

Yuuuup - been there, done that!

## iOS

As the rest of the world I've also created apps / games for the iPhone (or rather the iOS series of devices).

None of these are live in the App Store anymore.

### Angles
In Angles you must guess the value of 10 angles. The closer your guess is to the actual angle, the higher you score. Angles is primarily for pupils in the lower grades.

Angles currently comes with support for the following languages: English and Danish.

Go to [Angles source code](ios/Angles/).

![Intro](ios/img/angles1.jpg)
![Guess the angle](ios/img/angles2.jpg)
![Top 5](ios/img/angles3.jpg)

### iChains
In iChains you have to score points by exploding balls. To explode balls you must set of one or more chain reactions. The longer the chain the more points you score.
The game consists of 12 levels - each level gets progressively harder but all levels can be completed within a reasonably amount of time.
If you feel like it you can submit your personal best and hopefully achieve a position on the online iChains Top 100 List.

Go to [iChains source code](ios/iChains/).

## KaiOS

### KaiSub
KaiOS is a fun OS for feature phones. It's a bit limited and when I started to use it, it didn't contain a decent podcast player.
I used a Subsonic server as my main media server and it have a fairly decent podcast player.
KaiSub is a simple web system to bind your KaiOS device to the Subsonic Podcast player.

Go to [KaiSub source code](kaios/kaisub/).
