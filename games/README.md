# Games

Various small games in C, go-lang, Java and Python. Some of these games are my own creations and some of the games are heavily inspired by the past - ZX81.
Full credits are given (if I can find the original author).

These games should run natively on Mac OS, Linux and WSL(2) on Windows.

Please note - these games are not of high quality. They're are a result of me experimenting!
