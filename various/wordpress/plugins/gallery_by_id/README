Gallery by ID
=============

Galleries in WordPress are quite limited. If you insert a gallery you insert all
images for that page. Michael Fields tries to address this in his mf-gallery-shortcode plugin (which, unfortunately, have been pulled from the web).

My plugin is heavily inspired by the work already done in media.php (the Gallery
function) and by the work done by Michael Fields in his mf-gallery-shortcode
plugin.



Installation

 1. Download the plugin.
 2. Unpack it using gunzip or winzip.
 3. Copy the gallery_by_id.php file to your WordPress plugin folder.
 4. Log on to WordPress and activate the plugin.



Usage

 * Create a post or a page.
 * Upload a bunch of pictures.
 * Add a numeric value in the Menu Order field for each entry - lower numbered
   entries are shown first.
 * Somewhere on your post or page add the tag.
 * Substitute the "..." with your entries separated by commas.



Example

 * I've uploaded 6 pictures to the media library for the current page.
 * In the Menu Order field for the pictures I write 1 for the first picture,
   2 for the second and so forth.
 * On the current page I add to add the gallery. I could also just add to show
   odd numbered pictures only.
