archiver
========

Using Archiver you can expire posts on a given date.  The posts are moved to
another category and marked as 'draft'.


Installation

 1. Download the plugin.
 2. Unpack it using gunzip or winzip.
 3. Copy the entire archiver folder to your WordPress plugins folder.
 4. Log on to WordPress and activate the plugin.
 5. Go to Settings->Archiver and set the default category for archived posts.
 6. Add the following cronjob to your crontable:

    0 0 * * * cd $(ARCHIVER); $(PHP) -f archiverrunner.php >/dev/null 2>&1

    Where $(ARCHIVER) is the path to root of the archiver plugin and
    $(PHP) is the path to the php executable.  F.ex. if php is located in
    /usr/bin and archiver is in /var/www/domain/wordpress/wp-content/plugins
    the above line would be (broken into multiple lines):

    0 0 * * * cd /var/www/domain/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/archiver;
        /usr/bin/php -f archiverrunner.php >/dev/null 2>&1

    The cronjob should run one time pr. day. It will do the actual expiry of
    posts - so run it as close to the end of the day or start of the day
    (as above) for the best effect.


Usage

 * Create a post.
 * Enter your content, set category etc.
 * At the bottom of the page you'll find a new 'Archive' meta box.  Enter the
   day, month and year of when the post should expire.  Leaving these fields
   blank means that the post will never be expired.
