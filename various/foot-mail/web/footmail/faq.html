<DT>FootMail is a joke, right?</DT>
<DD>No - dead wrong! I use FootMail a lot when on the move. I connect using a Nokia 6230 Mobile Phone. When I know I have mail it is easy for me just to enter part of the senders email address in the filter box and the select <B>Filter</B> to find the mails ...</DD>

<DT>But why is it text only?</DT>
<DD>Well, being on the move means I need instant access to my Inbox. So instead of spending time (and money) on downloading some obscure graphics I decided to make FootMail entirely text only. This means fewer bytes to download.</DD>

<DT>When replying, the original text is lost?</DT>
<DD>Yes .. on some devices. I've seen this behaviour on a Nokia 6230. It only allows for around 700 characters in a textbox. So, a Nokia 6230 will refuse to show the text.</DD>
