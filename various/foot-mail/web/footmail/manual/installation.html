<H1>FootMail - Installation Manual</H1>
<P>FootMail is a collection of php scripts. FootMail should be able to run on most apache+php or iis+php combinations if the following requirements are met:
<UL>
<LI>A newer version of PHP is required, at least version 4.3.x. FootMail is developed and run on PHP-5.0.3.
<LI>PHP must support the imap library, at least version 2000.
<LI>Your webserver must be able to access your POP3 server.
</UL>
<P>FootMail is a single user installation. FootMail can run in a multiuser environment but it must be installed for every user.

<P><BR><P>
<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>Installation is simple:
<OL>
<LI>Transfer the <B>FootMail.tar.gz</B> archive to your Web server.
<LI>Unpack the archive: <PRE>tar xjf FootMail.tar.gz</PRE>
<LI>You now have a directory on your webserver called <B>FootMail-x.y</B>. Open up a webbrowser and point to to <PRE>http://your.domain/FootMail-x.y/</PRE> and click the Configure link to Configure FootMail.
</OL>

<P><BR><P>
<H3>Security</H3>
<P>As you will have noticed by now, there is absolutely no built in security in FootMail. However, do not despair! You can enhance the security of the FootMail directory by:
<OL>
<LI>Apache: place a .htaccess file in the directory.
<LI>IIS: add the FootMail directory as a web resource and place the appropriate permissions on the directory (and sub-directories/files).
</OL>
<P>If your client supports it, FootMail can be placed in a secure area of your webserver guarded by SSL or the like.
