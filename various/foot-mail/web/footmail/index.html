<H1>FootMail v1.7</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="foot.jpg" WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="50" ALT="FootMail"><I>FootMail</I> is a small POP3 mail client targeted towards tiny XHTML browsers, such as those found on mobile phones or PDAs.
<P><I>FootMail</I> is a lightweight system which should mainly be used as a way to access your Inbox while on the move. Besides browsing the Inbox you can also create new mails, reply to mails and do some simple maintenance. <I>FootMail</I> currently also supports very limited viewing of attachments.
<P><I>FootMail</I> is based on the principle that if you're on the move you have limited access - so there is no fancy graphics to distract you while accessing your Inbox ... (yep, it is text based! :-)
