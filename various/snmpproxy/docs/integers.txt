Deficiencies
   A deficiency in parsing large integers is shown when parsing the
   following rfc 1155 types:

                  Counter ::=
                      [APPLICATION 1]
                          IMPLICIT INTEGER (0..4294967295)

                  Gauge ::=
                      [APPLICATION 2]
                          IMPLICIT INTEGER (0..4294967295)

                  TimeTicks ::=
                      [APPLICATION 3]
                          IMPLICIT INTEGER (0..4294967295)

Due the size of a C long int the above ASN.1 is represented internally as:

Counter ::= [APPLICATION 1] IMPLICIT INTEGER (0..-1)

Gauge ::= [APPLICATION 2] IMPLICIT INTEGER (0..-1)

TimeTicks ::= [APPLICATION 3] IMPLICIT INTEGER (0..-1)

The ASN.1 library contains routines for encoding/decoding unsigned
long integers but you must hand code the cases where it is used - the
compiler never generates code that calls them.




The asn1uint.sh script mindlessly replaces any instances of BEncCounterContent
(and for gauges and ticks) from BEncAsnIntContent to BEncUAsnIntContent.
