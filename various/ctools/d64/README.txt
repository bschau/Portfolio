Unbeknownst to most - I (brian) was the original author of Neagox ... Back in
the days when Cutter (me!) did the coding, JTF (Hey PMA - will you ever see
this?) the gfx and TOP (Jacob - where are you?) composed this little game came
to life ...

Noise rocked!

The game itself is awful.   Got some fairly good criticism from (among others)
Hewson.  Scored well in coding, gfx and sound.   Did not so good in playability
and game play - which, to any extent, doesn't come as a surprise.

What is surprising though, is that we saw 2 or 3 cracks with up to 3 trainers.

... the world is a mysteriously place to live!
